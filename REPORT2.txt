In the presented Java code for sequence alignment using dynamic programming,
we implement the algorithm to find the optimal alignment between two given sequences. 
Below is a brief explanation of the approach and a summary of the time complexity analysis

Overall Time Complexity: O(n*m)
The Java code implements the algorithm for sequence alignment using dynamic programming. The approach involves:

Dynamic Programming Matrix:

A 2D matrix dp is utilized to store scores for partial alignments.
dp[i][j] represents the optimal score for aligning the first i characters of sequence x with the first j characters of sequence y.
Scoring Rules:

Scoring matrix defines scores for matching nucleotides or a nucleotide and a gap.
Updates to the matrix are based on three operations: match, delete, and insert.
Traceback:

After constructing the matrix, a traceback is performed to find the optimal alignment.
Starting from the bottom-right corner, arrows (diagonal, left, or up) guide the reconstruction.
Time Complexity Analysis:

Matrix Filling:

Nested loops result in a time complexity of O(nm), where n is the length of x and m is the length of y.
The dynamic programming matrix of size (n+1) x (m+1) is filled with scores.
Traceback:

Takes O(nm) time in the worst case, traversing the entire matrix.
